# Breaking Changes
Breaking your API consumers is one of the worst things an API team can do. It is also completely preventable. Defining a breaking change is difficult for many engineers -- it is not always obvious that changing the data model in a subtle way will break consumers. This is a great place to add automation, and help developers understand the impact of their changes.

<Toggle name="Prevent Breaking Changes" standard={BreakingChanges} />

**`exclude_operations_with_extension`** (optional): Sometimes you do not want breaking change checks to run.
- If you are working design-first the API will change a lot as you iterate on the design, failing work in progress does not make sense. Other teams o
- If you have a `draft` maturity stage for new API operations where stability is not promised to consumers.

In either case -- being able to say "skip these operations" is a useful affordance that supports a lot of real-world workflows.

If you set `exclude_operations_with_extension: "x-draft"`, than every API operation marked with that extension are skipped:

<TextInput standard={BreakingChanges} attribute="exclude_operations_with_extension" name="Exclude operations with extension" />

```yaml
paths:
  /example:
    get:  ## breaking changes allowed here
     summary: Get examples
     x-draft: true
    post:  ## breaking changes not allowed here
     summary: Post examples
```

## What breaking changes are checked?

### Request Parameters

- Prevent adding a required Query Parameter
> only applies to existing operations, new operations can have required query parameters

- Prevent changing an optional Query Parameter to required
> only applies to existing operations, new operations can have required query parameters


- Prevent adding a required Header Parameter
> only applies to existing operations, new operations can have required query parameters

- Prevent changing an optional Header Parameter to required
> only applies to existing operations, new operations can have required header parameters


- Prevent adding a required Cookie Parameter
> only applies to existing operations, new operations can have required query parameters

- Prevent changing an optional Cookie Parameter to required
> only applies to existing operations, new operations can have required cookie parameters

- Prevent restricting the options for an enum Parameter
> applies to parameters with enum schemas. Removing an option that was supported previously is a breaking change

- Prevent changing the type of Parameter
> applies to parameters with schemas. Incompatible type changes are a breaking change


### Operations

- Prevent removing an Operation
> applies to every operation


- Prevent removing a documented Response Status Code
> applies to every operation


### Request Body Properties

- Prevent making an optional Property required
> applies to existing properties in existing operations. Request Properties in new operations can be made required

- Prevent adding a required Property
> applies to existing operations. Adding required properties is a breaking change. Request Properties in new operations can be made required

- Prevent changing the type of Property
> Incompatible type changes are a breaking change

### Response Body Properties

- Prevent making a required Property optional
> applies to existing properties in existing operations. Response Properties in new operations can be made optional

- Prevent removing a required Property
> applies to existing operations. Removing required response properties is a breaking change.

- Prevent changing the type of Property
> Incompatible type changes are a breaking change
